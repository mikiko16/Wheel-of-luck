## Game Description:

This interactive wheel-of-fortune game offers players a chance to spin a colorful wheel and win various prizes, including a special "FreeSpin" feature. The game consists of 18 sectors, each marked with a unique prize or the "FreeSpin" label. Players tap the spin button to start the wheel, which rotates and lands on a random segment to reveal a prize.

### Key Features:
FreeSpin Feature: When the wheel lands on the "FreeSpin" sector, players are awarded three automatic spins. During these spins, prizes are won without any player interaction, and a special counter tracks the total winnings accumulated from FreeSpins.
Repeated Win Logic: For the first 10 spins, the game ensures the wheel lands on specific segments a set number of times, while avoiding consecutive spins on the same segment for a balanced, engaging experience.
Win Tracker: A display in the upper left corner tracks the player's current prize and FreeSpin winnings, updating after each spin to show the cumulative total and remaining FreeSpins.
The game provides an exciting mix of luck and anticipation, with colorful graphics and smooth animations to enhance the spinning experience. Whether aiming for a FreeSpin streak or high-value prizes, players will enjoy the thrill of watching the wheel decide their fortune.
